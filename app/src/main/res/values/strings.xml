    <string name="text1">French Bulldog Temperament: What\'s Good About \'Em, What\'s Bad About \'Em</string>
    <string name="text2">Despite his glum expression, the French Bulldog is comical, entertaining, and dependably amiable.\n\nAs comfortable in an apartment as he is on a farm, he is more lively than you might suspect from his chunky appearance. French Bulldog puppies are especially frisky, and ball chasing is one of their passions. Adults are more dignified and can be champion couch potatoes, but also love to clown around and go for walks in cool weather.\n\nMany Frenchies are friendly with everyone, while others are politely reserved. French Bulldogs will bark to announce visitors, but are otherwise quiet dogs.\n\nUsually peaceful with other pets (though some French Bulldogs will hunt small rodents), males may bicker with other males.\n\nThe French Bulldog is quite stubborn and can be challenging to train, yet also surprisingly sensitive, remembers what he learns, and responds well to early, patient, persistent training that utilizes food motivation.\n\nSnorting, snuffling, and flatulence go with the territory of short-faced breeds.\n\nSwimming pool owners must exercise caution: Because of his squat build and heavy head, most Frenchies cannot swim and will drown if they fall into a pool.</string>
    <string name="text3">If you want a dog who…</string>
    <string name="text4">Is smallish but very sturdy — not a delicate lapdog\n\nHas large expressive eyes\n\nHas a sleek easy-care coat that comes in many colors\n\nIs usually polite with everyone, including other pets\n\nTypically loves to play games and chase balls\n\nDoesn\'t need much exercise\n\nDoesn\'t bark much</string>
    <string name="text5">A French Bulldog may be right for you.</string>
    <string name="text6">If you don\'t want to deal with…</string>
    <string name="text7">Snorting, snuffling, wheezing, snoring, some slobbering\n\nGassiness (flatulence)\n\nStubbornness\n\nSlowness to housebreak\n\nQuite a few potential health problems due to his deformed face\n\nHigh cost</string>
    <string name="text8">A French Bulldog may not be right for you.</string>
    <string name="dog">dog</string>
    <string name="text9">Keep in mind that the inheritance of <b>temperament</b> is less predictable than the inheritance of <b>physical</b> traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training.</string>
    <string name="text10">You can avoid some negative traits by choosing an ADULT dog from an animal shelter or rescue group. With an adult dog, you can easily see what you\'re getting, and plenty of adult French Bulldogs have already proven themselves not to have negative characteristics.\n\nIf you want a puppy, you can avoid some negative traits by choosing the right breeder and the right puppy. Unfortunately, you usually can\'t tell whether a puppy has inherited temperament or health problems until he grows up.</string>
    <string name="text11">More traits and characteristics of the French Bulldog</string>
    <string name="text12">If I was considering a French Bulldog, I would be most concerned about…\n\n1. <b>Health problems.</b> Unfortunately, these nice-tempered dogs are deliberately bred with structural deformities that detract from the dog\'s quality of life. They especially have trouble breathing. You need to protect them from heatstroke and if your summers get hot, your home needs to be air-conditioned. Along with respiratory disorders, Frenchies also suffer from spinal disorders, eye diseases, heart disease, and joint diseases. Read more about French Bulldog Health.\n\n2. <b>French Bulldog sounds.</b> Because of their short face, most Frenchies snort, snuffle, wheeze, grunt, and snore loudly. These sounds are endearing to some people; nerve-wracking to others.\n\n3. <b>Slobbering.</b> Some French Bulldogs, especially those with heavy loose lips, slobber water when they drink. Some drool, too, especially after eating and drinking.\n\n4. <b>Gassiness (flatulence).</b> All short-faced breeds gulp air when they eat, and that air has to go somewhere, after all!\n\n5. <b>Stubbornness.</b> For such a small dog, French Bulldogs can be quite stubborn and manipulative. You must show them, through absolute consistency, that you mean what you say. Food is a great motivator for this breed, but it often results in a fat Frenchie who only obeys if you\'re waving a cookie. I recommend a more sensible training method.\n\n6. <b>Housebreaking.</b> French Bulldogs can be quite slow to housebreak. Expect four to six months of consistent crate training.</string>

    <string name="text13">Dog Training – What Works, And What Doesn\'t</string>
    <string name="text14">Treats can be great motivators. But if your dog will only obey for a treat, then HE is in charge of his obedience, not you.</string>
    <string name="text15">Many dog training methods are based on what makes the OWNER feel good, rather than on what actually makes sense to the DOG. For example…
\n\n\"<i>Positive only</i>\" dog training has become popular nowadays.
\n\nWith \"positive only\" dog training, you bribe your dog to do something with food or a toy. If he does the desired behavior, he receives the reward.
\n\n\"Positive only\" dog training often includes a clicker device – a little metal tab that makes a clicking sound when pressed with your thumb. <i>Clicker training</i> is a form of \"conditioning.\" You click at the precise instant your dog is doing some desired behavior, then immediately give a treat. The dog learns that whenever he hears the clicking sound, whatever behavior he was doing at that instant will bring him food.</string>
    <string name="text16">The problem with \"positive only\" dog training</string>
    <string name="text17">Positive-only dog training and clicker training work well for teaching fun things – like tricks – where it really doesn\'t matter whether your dog obeys or not. If you tell him to shake hands or roll over and he doesn\'t do it, who cares? But for teaching your dog to come when called in the presence of temptations or distractions.... for teaching your dog to stand quietly while his teeth are brushed or his coat is groomed.... for teaching your dog to act politely toward strangers and other animals....</string>
    <string name="text19">....and for teaching your dog all the other behaviors you want a well-behaved family dog to do (or not do!).... positive-only dog training is less effective.</string>
    <string name="text20">Think about it. What happens when you want your dog to stop chasing a cat and come to you – but at that particular moment he\'s not hungry and would rather chase the cat rather than munch on a biscuit?</string>
    <string name="t1">Owners who rely on positive-only dog training are stuck whenever their dog \"isn\'t in the mood\" to do something.</string>
    <string name="t2">An old trainer once said that if a dog really wants to chase a cat, he will chase it \"regardless of biscuits showering upon him like manna from heaven.\"</string>
    <string name="t3">Positive-only dog training does not teach your dog to respect you. And it is RESPECT that motivates a dog to be well-behaved even at times when he doesn\'t feel like it.</string>
    <string name="t4">Why <i>Respect Training</i> makes more sense to dogs</string>
    <string name="t5">Respect Training is a <b>balanced</b> philosophy of dog training. "Balanced" means both positive and negative consequences for one\'s behaviors.</string>
    <string name="t6">Real life for all living creatures consists of learning from both positive and negative consequences.</string>
    <string name="t7">Positive consequences encourage us to repeat a behavior.\n\nNegative consequences discourage us from repeating a behavior.</string>
    <string name="t8">For example, we hold the door open and someone says, \"Thank you!\" (positive), so we are likely to do it again. We take an extra-long lunch break and the boss docks our pay (negative), so we are less likely to do that again. We learn from both positive and negative consequences and behave accordingly.</string>
    <string name="t9">Your dog learns from both positive and negative consequences. Momma Dog will let Puppy know if he is playing reasonably or if he gets too rough.</string>
    <string name="t10">So do dogs. When a puppy plays with his mother, if his style of play is reasonable, she responds in a positive manner. But if he gets too rough, she is quick to correct with a growl.\n\nDoes Puppy become depressed and never play with another dog again? Of course not. He is happy to play – only more gently.\n\nDogs learn best from <b><i>balanced</i></b> dog training, where their behaviors can result in positive OR negative consequences.\n\n - <b><i>Positive consequences</i></b> means you reward desirable behaviors with praise, smiles, petting, games, and yes, treats.\n\n - <b><i>Negative consequences</i></b> means you correct undesirable behaviors with your voice, your facial expression, your body language, your hands, or with the leash or collar. Now I don\'t mean hitting, yelling, choke collars, or shock collars. I can show you how to correct your dog without being harsh or hurtful.</string>
    <string name="t11">Be realistic and fair with your dog. Show him positive and negative consequences so he can make an informed choice.</string>
    <string name="t12">By showing your dog both positive and negative consequences, he can make a conscious choice to do a behavior (or stop doing a behavior) – not only when he\'s in the mood for a reward/treat, but also when he might not care a hoot about the reward/treat but he still controls himself because he doesn\'t want a correction.
\n\nAll of life works this way – \"cause and effect.\"
\n\nAnd here\'s the best part....</string>
    <string name="t13">When YOU become the arbiter of your dog\'s behaviors – the one who gets to say yea or nay about what he\'s allowed to do – your dog feels respectful toward you.</string>
    <string name="t14">And once your dog respects you, he will listen to you. He will pay attention to you. He will do whatever you ask, and stop any misbehavior upon a single word from you.\n\nYou might like my article on Respect Training.\n\nOr just follow the complete, step-by-step Respect Training program(this app)</string>
    <string name="t18">Meet Kathy Armstrong and Jake</string>
    <string name="t15">Frustrated dog owners often call or email me when their dog has behavior problems and needs training. Here is \"Kathy\" calling about \"Jake\".</string>
    <string name="t16">I often get phone calls from distressed owners who are having trouble with their dog.
\n\nLet\'s listen in on a phone conversation between myself and a typical dog owner.... let\'s call her Kathy Armstrong.
\n\n<b>Kathy</b>: \"Michele, my dog Jake is being difficult! I can\'t make him do anything. He only listens to me when he\'s in the mood.\"
\n\n<b>Me</b>: \"I see. Would you say Jake is behaving rudely?\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b>: (surprised): \"What do you mean? How can a dog be rude?\"</string>
    <string name="t17">Ah, how indeed! Let us count the ways!</string>
    <string name="t19"><b>Me</b>: \"Does Jake sass you back when you tell him to do something? Does he bark back at you?\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b>: \"Well, yes, sometimes. If he doesn\'t want to do something.\"</string>
    <string name="t20"><b>Me</b>: \"Does he ever grumble at you when you wake him up? Or when you try to move him off his favorite chair? Or when you reach toward his food bowl while he\'s eating? Or when you touch some \"sensitive\" part of his body, like his tail or stomach or paw?\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b>: \"Yes, he does growl sometimes, but he\'s just telling me not to bother him.\"</string>
    <string name="t21"><b>Me</b>: \"Does he brace his legs and refuse to let go when you try to take something away from him?\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b>: \"Yes, if it\'s something he wants to keep for himself.\"</string>
    <string name="t22"><b>Me</b>: \"Does Jake persistently nudge or pester you for attention when you\'re trying to read a book or talk on the phone or visit with guests?\"
\n<b>Kathy</b>: \"Yes, when I\'m not paying attention to him.\"</string>
    <string name="t23"><b>Me</b>: \"Does Jake sometimes steal food off your plate when you leave it unattended? Does he get into the trash?\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b>:: \"Um…\"</string>
    <string name="t24"><b>Me</b>: \"When Jake doesn\'t get his own way or when he\'s upset with you, does he ever \"act out\" by chewing things up or peeing somewhere in the house?\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b>: \"Why, yes.....I think he does it to get back at me.\"</string>
    <string name="t25"><b>Me</b>: \"When you reach your hand toward Jake, does he sometimes dart away from you, keeping just out of reach?\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b>: \"Yes, he does....he doesn\'t want me to catch him if I\'m going to put his leash on or give him a bath.\"</string>
    <string name="t26"><b>Me</b>: \"When you catch Jake doing something wrong, does he run from you? Does he lead you on a merry chase around the house or yard?\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b>: \"Uh-huh. So he can\'t be scolded. He doesn\'t always come when I call him either, unless I have a cookie.\"</string>
    <string name="t27"><b>Me</b>: \"Does <b>Jake</b> decide who\'s welcome in your home and who isn\'t? Does he bark or grumble at visitors even after you\'ve let them in? Does he pitch a fit when he sees another dog?\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b>: \"Well, if he\'s excited… or if he doesn\'t like them…\"</string>
    <string name="t28"><b>Me</b>: \"Ah, and if he does like them, is he calm and polite? Or does he jump all over them?\"
\n\n<b>Silence. Then....</b>
\n\n<b>Kathy</b>: \"I\'m beginning to see your point.\"</string>
    <string name="t29"><b>Me</b>: \"And you said he only obeys when he\'s in the mood.
\n<b>Kathy</b> (sighing): \"You\'re right, Michele. Jake does do quite a few of those things. But are they really that bad?\"</string>
    <string name="t30"><b>Me</b>: \"I\'m afraid so. Those behaviors are rude and disrespectful. If a dog is allowed to do things that are rude and disrespectful, he starts believing that he is higher in the <b>pecking order</b> than YOU are.\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b> (puzzled): \"And the pecking order is…?\"
\n<b>Me</b>: \"It\'s like a ladder of hierarchy. Dogs are sociable animals who like to live with other sociable animals in a group or pack.
This \"pack instinct\" is built into your dog\'s genes, and it\'s a good thing. It\'s the reason dogs fit so tightly into our families.</string>
    <string name="t31">You see, when a dog joins your family, even if your family consists only of a single person – YOU – a pack is formed.</string>
    <string name="t32">Oh, yes, in his mind it certainly is, and his instincts compel him to seek out its structure. Who are the leaders, and who are the followers?
\n\nI\'ll give you a hint.....whoever is allowed to set the rules and make the decisions are the leaders.
\n\nThe rest are the followers.
\n\nIf you and your family members don\'t establish yourselves as the leaders, your dog may try to assume that role himself. His instincts tell him, you see, that a pack should have a leader.
\n\nAnd now you will see some of those \"rude and disrespectful\" behaviors. Your dog isn\'t really being rude or disrespectful. He is simply carrying out his role as a leader – making decisions about which of his behaviors are acceptable. Since you haven\'t assumed the role, HE has done it.\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b> (anxiously): \"But I don\'t want to rule over my dog. I just want him to be my friend.\"</string>
    <string name="t33">\"Getting back at you\"</string>
    <string name="t34">\"Telling off\" strangers or other dogs</string>
    <string name="t35">If your dog won\'t \"let\" you bathe him, the relationship between the two of you needs to be changed.</string>
    <string name="t36"><b>Me</b>: \"Kathy, friends are equals. Jake is your <b>dependent</b>. He depends on you for his health, his safety, his very life.\"
\n\nThere are times when you need to do things with Jake that he doesn\'t understand and doesn\'t like.
\n\nFor example, you might need to give medicine that tastes awful.... or take something dangerous out of his mouth..... or roll him onto his back so you can remove a tick from his belly.</string>
    <string name="t37">If your dog won\'t \"let\" you clean his teeth or take something out of his mouth, the relationship between the two of you needs to be changed.</string>
    <string name="t38">Jake may be smart, but he doesn\'t understand that medicines will help him, that some things he puts in his mouth could poison him or choke him, that ticks carry disease.
\n\nWithout this knowledge, Jake can\'t know what\'s best for him.
    \n\nFor his own safety, your dog must always accept YOUR greater knowledge and judgment.</string>
    <string name="t39">For your own peace of mind as your dog\'s guardian and caregiver, you must feel confident that you can restrain and handle him in any way you see fit, at any time you see fit.</string>
    <string name="t40">If your dog won\'t accept <b>minor</b> things such as clipping his toenails, or cleaning his teeth, or sitting quietly while you attach his leash....
\n\nIf your dog barks back at you, or pesters you constantly for attention, or won\'t shut up when people come to the door, or won\'t come when he\'s called....
\n\n....then he\'s certainly not going to accept some <b>major</b> things you might need to do with him to take proper care of him.</string>
    <string name="t41">If your dog won\'t \"let\" you groom him, the relationship between the two of you needs to be changed.</string>
    <string name="t42">You simply cannot take proper care of your dog if he doesn\'t recognize that you are the leader and he is the follower.</string>
    <string name="t43"><b>Kathy</b>: \"But I\'m worried that if I take charge all the time, he\'ll resent me.\"
\n\n<b>Me</b>: \"Oh no, Kathy, he\'ll respect you.... and that is a wonderful thing!
\nWhen your dog recognizes you as a capable leader worthy of respect, he will behave beautifully for you – and also he will feel happy and secure, because it\'s a great load off his shoulders.\"</string>
    <string name="t44">Let me explain why follower dogs feel so happy and secure</string>
    <string name="t45">1. Follower dogs feel secure because they know someone else is in charge.</string>
    <string name="t46">Your dog craves a leader who has everything under control. Then HE doesn\'t have to worry about trying to figure out our complicated world.</string>
    <string name="t47">Follower dogs can just relax and enjoy life while YOU handle all the decisions.</string>
    <string name="t48">2. Follower dogs feel happy because everyone likes them.</string>
    <string name="t49">Since follower dogs are so willing to listen to you, it\'s easy to teach them good behaviors.
\n\nPeople appreciate well-behaved follower dogs and are quick to pet them and compliment them. Dogs love this kind of attention.</string>
    <string name="t50">3. Follower dogs feel secure because they\'ve learned the consequences of everything they do.</string>
    <string name="t51">Follower dogs have been taught which behaviors bring them praise and petting, and which behaviors bring corrections.
\n\nThis clear distinction helps them choose which behaviors to do, and which behaviors to avoid.</string>
    <string name="t52">Dogs love the security of knowing what to do and what not to do.</string>
    <string name="t53">4. Follower dogs are happy because they\'ve learned what our human sounds mean.</string>
    <string name="t54">Like anyone who learns a foreign language, your dog feels confident and empowered when he understands what you\'re saying.</string>
    <string name="t55">If you want your dog to be a follower.... you need to be a leader</string>
    <string name="t56"><b>Kathy</b>: \"Okay, I like the idea that Jake will feel more secure when I teach him to be a follower dog. But why do I need to be a leader? Won\'t he learn from me if I just love him? Don\'t dogs want to please the people they love?\"
\n\n<b>Me</b>: \"Surprisingly, no. Dogs treat \"love\" and \"respect\" different. They love unconditionally, but they only want to <b>please</b> people they respect.\"
\n\nIf your dog is doing any of those behaviors we talked about earlier.....if he\'s not listening to you....then you\'ve lost at least some of his respect, and you need to know what to do to get it back.\"
\n\n<b>Kathy</b> (resolutely): \"I think I understand. Tell me what to do!\"
\n\n<b>Me</b>: \"Just follow the step-by-step Respect Training guide
\nYou\'ll learn how to teach Jake to be a respectful follower dog and then he\'ll pay attention to you and do what you say. Exactly what you\'ve been looking for!\"\nThanks For Readding :D</string>

    <string name="a1">Teach The Right Words In The Right Ways</string>
    <string name="a2">Doesn\'t it make sense that your dog needs to <b>understand</b> what you\'re saying before he can <b>DO</b> what you\'re saying?\n\nVocabulary words are the building blocks for getting your dog to do what you want him to do.</string>
    <string name="a3">I\'ve been training dogs and teaching dog obedience classes for over 35 years. I\'d like to show you the techniques. I\'ve developed for teaching <b><i>100 WORDS</i></b> to your dog that will make him the smartest, most well-mannered companion you\'ve ever had.</string>
    <string name="a4">Some of the dog training commands every dog should know and obey.</string>
    <string name="a5">For example, you definitely want your dog to know (and obey) the words in the picture!
\nMind you, you don\'t need to teach all 100 words. Even if you teach only a few of the words on my list, you\'ll still be rewarded with much better behavior.
\nEACH word you teach improves your dog\'s behavior just a little more.</string>
    <string name="a6">Why it\'s so good to teach your dog words</string>
    <string name="a7">They know <b>WHAT</b> to do.\n\nAnd they know what <b>NOT</b> to do.\n\nDogs love the security of knowing what to do and what not to do.</string>
    <string name="a8">And whoever teaches them these things is the person they come to view as their trusted leader.</string>
    <string name="a9">They look up to that person. They believe in that person. They trust that person to do anything with them, to handle them in any way necessary.</string>
    <string name="a10">You want yourself to be that person. Which is why YOU must always be the one to train your dog.</string>
    <string name="a11">You\'ve heard of dog training schools that promise to take your dog to their establishment and train him for you, then send him home to you?\n\nUnless your dog has a serious aggression problem requiring expert evaluation and treatment, I wouldn\'t even consider this.</string>
    <string name="a12">Dogs aren\'t robots who can be \"programmed\" by someone else to listen to YOU. Dogs listen to YOU and do what YOU say when they respect YOU – and they respect YOU when YOU are the teacher-leader who earns their respect.</string>
    <string name="a13">No one else can do that for you. You have to do it yourself. In fact, each member of your family has to earn your dog\'s respect for themselves.</string>
    <string name="a14">An educated dog is a true companion</string>
    <string name="a15">An educated dog is a thinking dog. He watches you. He pays close attention to you. He \"reads\" your facial expressions and body language. He listens carefully and pieces together individual words into complex actions.\n\n\"Where\'s your rope toy, Buffy? Where is it? Go find it. Oops, that\'s your hedgehog toy. Drop it. Good girl. Now go find your rope toy. Is it upstairs? Go upstairs. Upstairs. Get your rope toy. Good girl, you got it! Bring it here. Good! Now give it to me. Drop it. Good girl! Yay!\"</string>
    <string name="a16">Are you interested in a dog like that? Good for you! My dogs are like that – yours can be, too.</string>
    <string name="a17">First, your dog has to learn the meaning of all those words. That\'s where you come in.</string>
    <string name="a18">You need to know the best words to teach.\nAnd you need to know exactly how to teach them.</string>
    <string name="a19">In this App, I\'ll show you how to teach words to your dog in specific ways that encourage him to respect you. Then he will not only <b>understand</b> what you say, but also <b>DO</b> what you say.\n\nMy training method is based on sensible leadership that encourages your dog to respect you.

    <string name="a21">Solving Dog Behavior Problems</string>
    <string name="a22">All puppies (and adult dogs, too) do some things you would rather they not do!</string>
    <string name="a23">So you\'re reading this page because your dog is doing something you don\'t like – some behavior you want him to do differently – or simply <b>stop</b> doing.
\n\n- Housebreaking \"accidents"\n\n- Barks too much
\n- Won\'t let go of things
\n- Steals food when you turn your back
\n- Jumps on people
\n- Chews on your hands
\n- Constantly seeks attention
\n- Guards his food or toys
\n- Pulls on the leash
\n- Aggressive toward people or other dogs
\n- Struggles when you try to restrain him
\n- Chases the cat

\n- Did I mention housebreaking \"accidents\"?</string>
    <string name="a24">The \"magic word\" for virtually all dog behavior problems is \"No.\" But what you do AFTER you say \"No\" is the true solution for stopping dog behavior problems. Do you know what to do next?</string>
    <string name="a25">\"How can I stop my dog from....?\"</string>
    <string name="a26">One of the most common questions dog owners ask me is: \"How can I stop my dog from (doing some <b>specific</b> behavior problem)?\"
smiley face\nThey\'re hoping I\'ll tell them where to find a secret button on the back of their dog\'s head that will trigger a <b>misbehavior-OFF switch</b>.
Alas, my answer is almost always the same, no matter what the misbehavior is. Here it is (free of charge):</string>
    <string name="a27">You need to tell your dog, \"No. Stop that.\"</string>
    <string name="a28">Does that sound too simplistic? It probably does, because most owners respond in a frustrated voice, \"But I already tell my dog No! He still doesn\'t listen!\"
Fair enough. Here is what is going on. Either he really doesn\'t understand what No means (this is the truth in MANY cases), or else he understands it but doesn\'t see any reason why he should obey it.</string>
    <string name="a29">There are two key points here, you see…your dog must <b>understand</b> the word (I can show you how to teach words properly) and then he must <b>respect</b> you enough to obey it.
\nBecause without respect, your dog may UNDERSTAND what you say, but he doesn\'t see any reason why he should DO what you say. (Unless you\'re bribing him with a cookie, which only works sometimes – usually NOT when you need it most.</string>
    <string name="a30">Getting your dog to respect you means interacting with him in specific ways that encourage respect.</string>
    <string name="a31">No matter how large or how small, all dogs need to respect their owners. I teach my small dogs to respect me in the exact same ways I taught my German Shepherds.</string>
    <string name="a32">You might be thinking, \"But I already know how to interact with my dog. I care for him and I love him.... it\'s easy.\"
Actually, it isn\'t so easy, because canines see and interpret the world differently than we do.
Whenever you do <b>anything</b> with your dog, even just walking through the kitchen, or petting him, or speaking to him.... he is busy judging your tone of voice, your facial expression, your body language, how you\'re touching him, how you\'re responding when he does \"X\" or \"Y\".
All of these seemingly little things are very, very important to your dog. They\'re the clues he uses to draw conclusions about you and to decide whether you\'re worthy of respect or not.
\n\n- If you interact with your dog in certain ways that are WRONG for canines, he will conclude that even though he loves you, he doesn\'t need to obey you. And you will see behavior problems.
\n\n- If you interact with your dog in all the RIGHT ways, he will conclude that he not only loves you, but also that you\'re a capable leader worthy of respect. Then he will obey when you say, \"No. Stop that.\" (assuming, of course, that you have taught him what it means so that he understands)</string>
    <string name="a33">Respectful dogs don\'t misbehave.
It is as simple as that.</string>
    <string name="a34">Well, okay....ALMOST as simple as that. There are a few more things your dog needs in order to be well-behaved.</string>
    <string name="a35">Dogs need enough exercise and active play sessions to tire them out. Some dogs need only moderate exercise, while others need LOTS to make them feel content. You must meet the needs of your particular dog.</string>
    <string name="a36">Exercise, Activities, Companionship</string>
    <string name="a37">Even respectful dogs will misbehave if they don\'t get enough exercise, interesting activities to do, and daily companionship.
Dogs are sociable creatures.</string>
    <string name="a38">- If you leave your dog home alone for 8 hours, he will feel bored and frustrated.
\n\n- If you leave him outside for hours at a time, he will feel bored and frustrated.
\n\n- If you don\'t provide enough exercise and activities, he will feel bored and frustrated.</string>
    <string name="a39"><b>Boredom and frustration</b> are major causes of behavior problems in dogs.
Dogs vent boredom and frustration by destroying things.... digging holes.... rambunctiousness.... escaping.... barking...</string>
    <string name="a40">Those \"misbehaviors\" cannot be solved by training. Your dog has every right to vent his boredom and frustration when his needs of Exercise and Companionship are not being met.
You must meet those needs while ALSO teaching commands and a respectful attitude. That\'s how you raise a well-behaved dog.</string>
    <string name="a41">What you should do right now to prevent or stop behavior problems</string>
    <string name="a42">You need to learn the right ways to interact with your dog – and the wrong ways too, so you don\'t do those!
You need to know how to teach the Magic Word (\"No\") to your dog and how to respond if he doesn\'t obey it.
That\'s how you stop behavior problems. With that one word.... plus respect... plus however much exercise and companionship it takes to keep your dog satisfied.

    <string name="a43">Puppy Training Schedule: What To Teach Puppies, and When</string>
    <string name="a44">Puppy training starts the moment you bring your puppy home. Whatever he does, you must react properly or he will learn the wrong things.</string>
    <string name="a45">We always anticipate the joys of all that\'s good about owning a puppy.
\n\nBut often it doesn\'t work out as well as we\'d hoped. Puppies are delightful bundles of energy and curiosity.... but they can also be exasperating and frustrating.
\n\nIf you respond properly to the challenges of bringing a new puppy into your home, the adjustment period will be shorter and less stressful for both of you.
\n\n<b>If you do not respond properly.....</b> well, unfortunately that\'s why so many teenage dogs are turned over to rescue groups and animal shelters.</string>
    <string name="a46">Routines are reassuring to puppies. For example, his food and water bowls should stay in one place.</string>
    <string name="a47">What you must get right when raising a puppy</string>
    <string name="a48">First and foremost, teach your new puppy <b>daily routines</b>.
\n\n- Where his food and water dishes are located.
\n\n- What times of day he will eat.
\n\n- Where his bed is.
\n\n- What time he goes to bed.
\n\n- What time he gets up.
\n\n- Where he goes to the bathroom.
\n\n- Where his toys are kept.
\n\nDon\'t make the mistake of thinking that it doesn\'t matter <b>HOW</b> you teach each of these routines. It definitely does matter.
\n\n- If you use the right teaching method, your puppy will be better-behaved and will be happy to let you decide what he can and can\'t do in your family.
\n\n- If you use the wrong teaching method, your puppy will begin making decisions about how he wants YOU to fit into HIS life. That\'s a recipe for conflict and behavior problems.</string>
    <string name="a49">Teach your puppy words</string>
    <string name="a50">These words are taught AFTER your puppy has learned the two most important words: \"No\" and \"Good\".</string>
    <string name="a51">You must teach your puppy words as well as routines.
\n\nThe most important words are \"No\" (which means \"Stop whatever you\'re doing\") and \"Good\" (which means \"I like what you\'re doing\").
\n\nThese praise and correction words should be started at 2-3 months of age.
\n\nYou must teach these words properly, with the right tone of voice and the right body language, or they won\'t be of any help in teaching other words.
\n\nIf your puppy is older than 2-3 months and hasn\'t learned \"No\" and \"Good\" flawlessly, you must start with those words before you can expect success with other word training.</string>
    <string name="a52">Avoid biscuit training</string>
    <string name="a53">Most puppies love treats, but don\'t RELY on them to teach good behavior.</string>
    <string name="a54">It\'s a big mistake to rely on food treats to train your puppy (or a dog of any age).
\n\nWhat\'s wrong with \"biscuit training\"? It\'s based on your puppy deciding when he\'s hungry enough to do what you want.
\n\nImagine your puppy running out the front door. You call him, waving a treat. But he\'d rather chase a squirrel into the road than come back to munch on a treat. In addition to the obvious danger of Puppy getting hit by a car, he learns that he doesn\'t have to listen to you. He learns that he\'s in charge of what he decides to do and what he decides not to do.
\n\nNow, I\'m not saying you shouldn\'t give ANY treats to your puppy. Treats can be great motivators, especially in teaching fun things such as tricks.</string>
    <string name="a55">But if your training method consists of giving your puppy a treat to coax him to do what you say, then you\'re going to find yourself in trouble when you want him to do something and he\'s not hungry.... or when you want him to STOP doing something and he\'s having too much fun to stop, regardless of the treats you\'re desperately flinging at him.</string>
    <string name="a56">This sad scenario happens a lot with biscuit training. It doesn\'t happen at all with \"Respect Training\".</string>
    <string name="a57">Respect training is the best way to train your puppy</string>
    <string name="a58">A puppy who is taught to respect you will pay close attention to you.</string>
    <string name="a59">You should teach your puppy to respect you as the leader in your home.
\n\nWithout proper respect, your puppy may learn words and routines but choose not to do them. I\'m sure you know dog owners who say their dog \"understands\" them but doesn\'t do what they say.
\n\nThey might even try to laugh it off by saying, \"He\'s so smart he has ME trained!\"
But that isn\'t intelligence – it\'s disrespect. And it can be traced to improper training right from the time the puppy was first brought home.</string>
    <string name="a60">Chihuahua and Papillon, listening carefully for words they know</string>
    <string name="a61">Respect training is not something you can get \"almost\" right. You must get it completely, consistently right – in a way that dogs understand. I can help you with this.
Dogs are capable of learning many words, and there is no better way to get your dog to understand what you want and what you don\'t want than to teach him carefully chosen vocabulary words.
Of course, knowing which words to teach isn\'t much help unless you also know HOW to teach them. I can help you with this, too. Keep reading.
First, I\'ll give you a hint. The photo above is cute, but don\'t expect your dog to want to listen to children\'s stories!</string>
    <string name="a62">But do expect him to listen carefully to your words, waiting for one he understands. Expect him to be eager to follow your directions.</string>
    <string name="a63">Puppy training schedule… more training at 2–3 months</string>
    <string name="a64">Crate training (2–3 months)</string>
    <string name="a65">Your puppy\'s crate is his safe and secure den.
\n\nSome people mistakenly refer to a crate as \"doggie jail\" but that is not the way Puppy will view his crate.
\n\nOh, at first he might be unhappy to have his movements curtailed, but it won\'t be long at all before he goes into the crate on his own, to take a nap or just to get away from household activity.</string>
    <string name="a66">A crate protects your puppy from household dangers and is an invaluable aid in housebreaking.</string>
    <string name="a67">For a new puppy, a crate helps with housebreaking and provides a safe den for sleeping. When your puppy is used to his crate, it will be easy to take him visiting, or for trips in the car, or to the vet. When we watch TV, we sit in our favorite chairs and our dog Buffy chooses to lie down in her crate, watching the same shows we watch (well, sort of!).</string>
    <string name="a68">Housebreaking (2–3 months)</string>
    <string name="a69">At 2–3 months old, puppies are infants and won\'t have reliable control of their bladder for several months. (Tiny breeds are notoriously difficult to housebreak and take even longer.)</string>
    <string name="a70">Still, housebreaking begins the day you bring your puppy home.</string>
    <string name="a71">Establish the right pattern from the very beginning and Puppy will be housebroken as soon as his internal organs can cooperate.</string>
    <string name="a72">But if you do it wrong, housebreaking will become a nightmare. And sadly, many owners don\'t realize they\'re doing something wrong until Puppy\'s \"accidents\" have become a bad habit.... and bad habits are hard to undo. So you want to establish the right pattern from the very beginning.
\n\nThere are several methods of housebreaking, including using a crate, an exercise pen (\"ex-pen\"), a doggy door leading into a small potty yard, or a litter box (for tiny breeds).
\n\nYou\'ll find detailed housebreaking directions in my training book (see bottom of page) – and yes, I cover each one of those housebreaking methods so you can choose which one works best for your dog and your lifestyle.</string>
    <string name="a73">Acceptance of being handled (2–3 months)</string>
    <string name="a74">Your puppy must accept YOU as the leader in your family. Being the leader simply means you are the one who decides what is okay for Puppy to do and what isn\'t okay.
\n\nFor example.... brushing, bathing, clipping nails, cleaning teeth, giving a pill, putting on a collar or harness.
\n\nThese are all times when YOU – not Puppy – have to be the one to decide what is necessary. Puppy should stand quietly for anything you need to do with him.
\n\nThe best way to do this is to include it in your vocabulary lessons and your respect lessons. If you teach words and respect properly, acceptance of being handled will come naturally – they go \"hand-in-hand\", so to speak!</string>
    <string name="a75">Start handling your puppy immediately so he learns to accept anything you need to do with him.</string>
    <string name="a76">Gentleness (2–3 months)</string>
    <string name="a77">Just like acceptance of being handled, gentleness is taught along with vocabulary and respect training.
\n\nPuppy\'s mother (and siblings) began teaching gentleness by firmly correcting Puppy when he played too roughly.
\n\nYour job is to take over from where they left off and teach Puppy how to restrain himself when he plays with humans.</string>
    <string name="a78">Teach your puppy to be gentle when interacting with people. He must not nip or chew on people\'s hands.</string>
    <string name="a79">Remember, you must be the one who sets the limits of ALL good and bad behavior.</string>
    <string name="a80">Household rules (2–3 months)</string>
    <string name="a81">Teach Puppy which behaviors are allowed in your house and which behaviors aren\'t.
\n\nIs he allowed to shred the toilet paper? (no)
\n\nIs he allowed to jump up on the furniture, or into the lap of a seated person? (that\'s up to you, but everyone in your family must follow the same policy or Puppy will be hopelessly confused)
\n\nIs he allowed in the kitchen when meals are being prepared? (can be unsafe if things get dropped)
\n\nCan he take a toy away from another dog in the family? (absolutely not! it might look cute but it can lead to bullying and dominance battles later)
\n\nCan he take socks out of the laundry basket? Can he sleep on your bed at night? What about barking at strangers he sees through the window?</string>
    <string name="a82">This particular behavior would be a \"No\".</string>
    <string name="a83">Decide on the household rules. Then be completely consistent about enforcing what you have decided. \"No!\" and \"Good!\" will serve you well for these puppy lessons, but only if you have taught those words properly.</string>
    <string name="a84">My training book spends a lot of time showing you how to teach those words, and also tells you the best rules to establish with your puppy.</string>
    <string name="a85">Is your puppy older than 2–3 months?</string>
    <string name="a86">You might think a training schedule would be different for an older puppy.... but it isn\'t.
\n\nWhether your puppy is 3 months old, 6 months old, or 9 months old, the order of training must start with the same vocabulary words and respect training I\'ve been talking about.
\n\nNamely.... daily routines, praise and correction words, crate training, housebreaking, acceptance of being handled, gentleness, and household rules.
\n\nSo if your older puppy is still mouthing on your hands, or barking back at you when you tell him to do something, or if he doesn\'t stop whatever he\'s doing when you say, \"No\", you mustn\'t rush on to \"heel\" or \"sit-stay\".
\n\n<b>Respect needs to come first, no matter how many months it takes.</b> Then you can move on to....</string>
    <string name="a87">- Walk on the leash without pulling.
\n\n- Come when called. Every time.
\n\n- Lie down – and stay lying down for up to 30 minutes.
\n\n- Wait inside the door or gate, even when it\'s open, until you tell him he can go through.
\n\n- Stop barking when you say "Quiet."
\n\n- \"Give\" or \"Drop\" whatever is in his mouth when told.
\n\n- and much, much more
\n\nAll of these skills involve Puppy learning new words, but remember, simply knowing what a word "means" won\'t automatically lead to Puppy DOING it.
\n\n<b>You need to teach these new words in specific ways that encourage Puppy to view you as a worthy leader</b>. Popping treats into his mouth won\'t accomplish that.
\n\nNow, leadership doesn\'t mean hitting Puppy. No choke collars or shock collars. Just little things you need to say and do every time you interact with Puppy. These little things are viewed as \"leadership\" by the canine mind.
\n\n<b>All puppies misbehave from time to time. How you respond when Puppy misbehaves is very, very important</b>.
\n\n- If you respond the wrong way, he will keep misbehaving.
\n\n- Respond the right way and he will view you as a leader and listen to you.</string>
    <string name="a89">It\'s best to get this right the first time around, because Puppy won\'t ever be the same age again. You get only one chance to teach all the right habits to a \"clean slate\" puppy. If you try to train your puppy without help, you will probably have to re-do the lessons, only this time with an older puppy with bad habits.</string>
    <string name="a88">Sit, stay, heel....older puppies are ready to start learning more advanced words only after they are obeying basics such as \"No.\" Don\'t jump ahead!</string>
    <string name="a90">You don\'t need to sign up for an obedience class to get help training your puppy. I\'ve taught hundreds of those classes and they can be overwhelming for a puppy. Timid puppies can get overrun by bullies, and excitable puppies just get more excitable.
\n\nYou can teach your puppy at home. I\'ll help you. In this app, I\'ll show you a step-by-step training schedule for teaching your puppy all the vocabulary words he needs, plus consistent household rules and routines, housebreaking, crate training, acceptance of being handled, gentleness, and obedience training.
\n\nMost importantly, I\'ll show you how to teach your puppy to respect you so that he actually does what you say. Thanks for using this app.</string>
